# py-fhe
A Python library for fully homomorphic encryption. Currently, we include an implementation of the Brakerski-Fan-Vercauteren (BFV) scheme, the Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song (CKKS) scheme, and bootstrapping for CKKS.

## Installation

To install the library run the following command in the root folder:
```sh
pip install -e .
```

This should install the necessary dependencies. You can then run all the unit tests as follows:
```sh
pytest
```

See the examples folder for examples on how to use the library.
